### React challenege

#### How to run the application
This project is using yarn as a package manager so you will need yarn on your machine.

If you dont have yarn please install it by this command:
```
npm install --global yarn
```

If you do have yarn, please install the latest dependencies:
```
yarn install
```

After you have installed the dependencies you can run the application:
```
yarn run start
```
